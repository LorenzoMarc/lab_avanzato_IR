If they try (Iran's nuclear program), you have no choice butto destroy them."


2: Says President Ronald Reagan "didn't come into office with a single shred of evidence that the Republicans were actually involved in terrorism." Former Soviet leader Yuri Andropov did.

###---GENERATING 10 samples on keywords:  ['economic', 'stimulus']
1: "This is not the first time that we've had a Republican-led government shutdown." ​ “That’s also true for businesses. Last year it was 12 times under Trump; now there were multiple occasions when...we have two consecutive Democratic congresses after this one to shut down business again in 2017 … This will be different!"


2: The economic stimulus bill "didn’t create one new job." It has caused 120,000 jobs to be lost. And the Congressional Budget Office says it will cost every household in this country $1 later on if we don't spend our money appropriately and responsibly: raising taxes for businesses that make no profit at all; cutting spending so low there's almost no tax increase."


3: The stimulus bill "didn’t create one new job." And while it did reduce the federal deficit in 2010 by $800 billion dollars per year -- more than double all of President Barack Obama's economic policies combined and nearly six times
for all but eight years prior.


4: Says President Barack Obama has the same economic stimulus proposal as Mitt Romney. But his plan "is more than 15 percent tax increase." That's higher per dollar you pay when you're making $100,000 and rising again when your salary is declining dramatically.


5: "For every one job created in the last three years... there are 35 new government jobs."  ... I can’t find a single economist who said this.  Do you know how many private-sector economists have said it? 100,000 total jobs just for COVID right here (in Texas)."


6: "The economic stimulus has not created one new job." ​. ​


7: The economic stimulus bill "has cost 10 million jobs." That's higher than the number of people who've lost their job because they tried to give up health insurance. It’s also more expensive for families that have a lot on food stamps and Medicaid" under Obamacare.


8: The economic stimulus bill "didn’t create one new job." It has only increased the number of temporary positions created. And it will cost taxpayers more than $500 billion over 10 years -- far less when you consider inflation and trade surpluses combined; yet... no other country in America is near enough to fill those spots quickly."


9: "When the economic stimulus was sent -- it went to China in 2001 and they were not happy."  They wanted more. "They said if you don't do this now their jobs will be lost because of your decisions;your policies aren’t effective or that's what I support.''


10: The economic stimulus bill "has created over 700,000 jobs." But it has caused "$800 billion in job losses" for Wisconsin residents. It's worth repeating that Foxconn hasn't made those claims:  the company hasn’t laid off 800 workers or cut its workforce since the economic crisis began back then... In fact, the UW-Madison wind industry is so small now because of all these new tax increases and mandates.
